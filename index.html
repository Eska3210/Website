                <p>I am a passionate and results-oriented computing professional with a background in academia, project management, and leadership. This combined experience has given me the skills and knowledge to excel as a Computing Lecturer and Programme Lead, interviewing, training, mentoring and leading Computer Science Lecturers.</p>
                <p>Increasing my professional network, I have established valuable connections with industry leaders from Lloyds Bank, Yorkshire Water, CalderIT, Future Transformations, Hippo, Answer Digital, Parall.ax and more. These connections not only provide guest speaker opportunities for students but also offer real-world insights into current trends and career paths.</p>
                <p>I am an avid learner, actively attending live webinars on AI, robotics and emerging technologies to stay ahead of the curve and incorporate these advancements into my teaching. I also attend tech events to further this learning and being part of tech groups.</p>
                <p>My leadership skills were built at Huddersfield University's laptop rental service. For four years, I managed every aspect of the scheme, from overseeing staff and ensuring smooth operations at University of Huddersfield campus. This experience instilled in me invaluable skills in project management, team building, and navigating complex organisational structures. More importantly, it taught me the power of collaboration with senior university leaders to achieve ambitious goals.</p>
                <p>Achieving a distinction in my MSc Computer Science programme, I consistently excelled amongst my all-male cohort, securing high grades. Navigating a highly competitive environment gave me leadership skills, resilience, and ability to excel under pressure, qualities I translate in lecturing to effectively guide and challenge students. Thriving in such an environment further motivated me to build an inclusive learning environment where all students, regardless of background, can excel.</p>
